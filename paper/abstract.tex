\abstract{In this research paper, we analyze the fMRI data from the study done
  by Repov and Barch exploring the relationship between schizophrenia and brain
  connectivity \cite{repovs_barch1, repovs_barch2}. Instead of reproducing
  ANOVA analysis of within and between brain network connectivity, we focus on
analyzing fMRI scans of one subject using generalized linear model. Before
data analysis, we smoothed the data spatially and corrected noise in the fMRI
data. On the preprocessed data, we perform student t test to identify the voxels
responding to designed stimulus. Having localized the activated voxels, we
closely examine the behavior of these voxels and validated our assumptions.}
