\section{Data}

The data used in their published paper is available on the website OpenFMRI.org.
The are many data files grouped by subjects, but we will be focusing on only one
schizophrenic subject--subject 001, who is male, Caucasian and Schizophrenic.
The data has four dimensions (91 $\times$ 109 $\times$ 91 $\times$ 137), 
consisting of three dimensional voxels that are moving across time. We removed 
the first four outlying data along the time dimension, which leaves us 133 images. 
(Need to add how to come to understand the BOLD signal = signal + noise, and 
the necessity of remove noise)
