\section{Obstacles}

Due to our limited knowledge on brain anatomy, we are unable to specify which
part of the brain are tested to be responding to the Nback tasks. The
biggest challenge is figuring out which direction our research would take and
which analysis we have learned to apply to our fMRI data. We also spent a lot of
time on understanding the design of the Nback task. The task design is not the
usual block design we have seen from class, and the data provides incomplete
information on condition files. In addition, since we did not learn how
to analyze multiple subjects who have different brain shapes, we focused on a
single subject. It took us sometime to become familiar with Github workflow, and
writing linear models on Python was also challenging. However, as a group we
worked together and helped each other whenever there's a question. We eventually
narrowed down our research to linear modeling, and we were able to meet as a
group regularly to discuss our project and review each other's codes.
